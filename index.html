                    <div class="update">
                        <h5>Respository created.</h5>
                        <p>The first thing we needed to do was this. <br>
                            Commited the Readme. Commited to the goal. This is what we need to do, right?
                        </p>
                        <h5>Website make</h5>
                        <p>Yep this thing, which you are reading currently. <br>

                    <h2>Future Goals</h2>
                    <h5>Creating engaging storyline for the game</h5>
                    <p>We have a good and engaging storyline but we believe in improvising daily until we reach a point
                        where no
                        one is sad about the story.</p>
                    <h5>Your game, your ending</h5>
                    <p>We want to keep the story and gameplay totally depended on user input, so your game may have
                        different
                        ending and not what your friends got. This is hard to do and hard to achieve but we are ready to
                        take up
                        the challenge.</p>
                    <h5>Adverts?</h5>
                    <p>We also know that no one likes adds, so we will be keeping no adds. If you are stuck watch a add
                        and take
                        a hint, otherwise the entire game is add-free.</p>
